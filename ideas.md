# common-infrastructure
MIT symposium talking points for the discussion session on common infrastructure.

## Talking points
**Introductory Remarks**:
Few slides of introduction about:
- Importance of a unified infrastructure in the neuroscience domain.
- A brief review of existing infrastructures.

**Discussion Points**:

**a. Current State of Neurophysiology/Neuroinformatics Infrastructure**
- What are the main platforms/tools currently used in neuroinformatics?
- Which of these are universally adopted and why?
- What are the limitations of the current infrastructures in place?

**b. Common Challenges and Potential Solutions**
- Storage: How can we efficiently store large and diverse datasets?
- Integration: How can we ensure different neurophysiology datasets can be seamlessly integrated?
- Scalability: What challenges arise when scaling up, and how can we address them?
- Standardization: How can we ensure data from various sources adheres to a common format or standard?

**c. Opportunities for Collaboration and Resource Sharing**
- Are there ongoing projects or initiatives that can be synergized?
- How can institutions globally collaborate for a more cohesive effort?
- The role of open-source in promoting collaboration.
- Strategies to encourage sharing of datasets, tools, and computational resources among researchers.

**d. Improving Accessibility and Usability of Neuroinformatics Tools and Resources**
- Design principles for user-friendly neuroinformatics tools.
- Training and documentation: Ensuring users know how to use tools and access resources.
- Making tools universally available: Addressing barriers such as high computational requirements or proprietary software limitations.
- Ensuring tools and resources are inclusive for researchers from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of resources.

## Additional Discussion Suggestions

Explore what could be the bareers preventing an infrastructure from becoming widely adoptable.

## Concluding Remarks
- Recap of the primary challenges identified and solutions discussed.
- Action items: Steps to be taken after the session, responsibilities, and timelines.
- Encouragement for ongoing collaboration and communication among participants.

## Included in slides


**Financial Barriers**
- Are there high costs associated with adopting or maintaining platform?
- Are there cheaper or open-source alternatives that labs are using?
- Is there a perception that the platform doesn't offer value for its cost?

**Trust and Data Security**
- Are labs concerned about the security of their data on the platform?
- Are there clear guidelines and measures on data privacy and user rights?

**Customization and Flexibility**
- Can labs customize the platform to suit their specific needs, or is it a "one-size-fits-all" solution?
- How easy is it to integrate the platform with other tools or workflows already in use by the labs?

**Usability and Accessibility**
- Is the platform user-friendly? A steep learning curve can deter many from adopting a new tool or platform.
- Is there sufficient documentation, tutorials, and community support?
- Is the platform accessible for labs with limited computational resources or without specific technical expertise?

**Feedback Loop**
- Is there a mechanism for users to provide feedback and suggestions for the platform?
- How responsive is the platform's development or support team to user needs and concerns?
- How do you provide support, Q&As, etc. efficiently with limited resources (few maintainers/comunity manager)?

## I think unrelated to *infrastructure* 

**Incentives and Recognition**
- Is there sufficient academic or institutional recognition for labs that contribute to or adopt the platform?
- Are there clear benefits (e.g., easier collaborations, more citations) for using the platform?
